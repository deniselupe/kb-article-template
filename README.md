# Knowledgebase Article Template

Originally a template I created to propose improvements of the look and feel of my employer's current knowledgebase. For confidentiality purposes, color scheme, logos, fonts, and article content has been changed. You can visit the live page [here](https://deniselupe.github.io/kb-article-template/).
